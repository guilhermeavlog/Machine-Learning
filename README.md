# ℹ️ Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms that I implemented **from scratch** and using popular ML frameworks. Each notebook walks through a complete workflow — data loading, preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization.

The goal of this project is to provide:

- A **clear, approachable learning resource** for fundamental ML concepts  
- A set of **clean, well-commented notebooks** you can reference or extend  
- A demonstration of core ML algorithms without relying on scikit-learn’s abstractions  

This repo fits into the broader ML learning ecosystem as a **practical alternative** to dense textbooks or black-box libraries. If scikit-learn gives you great tools and textbooks give you the theory, this repository aims to give you **real understanding through implementation**.
